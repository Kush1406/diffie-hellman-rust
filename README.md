# Diffie-Hellman-protocol

Alice and Bob are two clever kittens who have lost their mittens. They need to send secret messages to each other to coordinate finding them because, if their caretaker cat finds out, they will be called naughty kittens and won't get any pie!

Despite their tiny paws and fluffy appearance, these kittens have been studying modern public key cryptography. They have learned a technique called elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange. By using this method, they can securely exchange secret keys and communicate privately. This way, they can organize their search for the lost mittens without getting caught, ensuring they still get to enjoy their delicious pie.
